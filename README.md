## Reason for this project 

This site will be used to help pepromote demonstrating minatures people have painted and allow commisions to be arranged or just to show case their work.


## UX

This site is designed to advertise a store where people are able to visit in order to request painting commisions done for there models, they will also be able to purchase advertised projects.

### User stories

As a user i would like to -
* find examples of commisions that match what they are looking for 
* easily message commissionersto make an enquiry about their work
* easily message commisioners in order to purchase displayed work
* find out where the store is as you may not want work posted

### Logo

## Future builds 

The site will be intended to facilitate sales, bids on already painted models and a funtion to allow commissions to be made with more ease, eg. Allow people to select amount of models quality of painting when the commision should be achieved by and allow the person fulfilling the commission to quote accordingly.

Depending on how many users it may be feasable to allow a function to allow people to search through different commissioners

Passing

From github pages the link can be copied and used in an IDE to open the site.

* Responsiveness was tested in dev tools on google chrome, microsoft edge, mozilla and firefox. The site was also tested live on iphoneX safari, amazon kindle fire10 and widows desktop.
* Testing was conducted bu
  1. Using dev tools responsiveness was tested by reducing the horizontal screen size
  2. the device setting was selected and then the orientation was changed
  3. All navigational links were checked by clicking on them
  4. buttons were selected to see if you were taken to the correct place
  5. forms were filled out to see if each required field worked as intended and if you were taken to the dump page.

## Bugs

### Home page sections

On the home page the first section would not perform as intened taking into account the justify content parameter of the class attached.
I used unauthordox code in order to get the lower section to act as intended and used <li> to group the actual list which was nested inside the parent nest in order to get the image to sit next to the nested lists correctly.

### Gallery images

The images should line up so images in land scape or portrait are next to each other. I considered using Grid for this but was unable to learn and impliment it due to time constraints.
