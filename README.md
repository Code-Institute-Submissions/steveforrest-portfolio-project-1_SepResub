# Portfolio Project 1 

## Reason for this project 

This site will be used to help pepromote demonstrating minatures people have painted and allow commisions to be arranged or just to show case their work.

## Future builds 

The site will be intended to facilitate sales, bids on already painted models and a funtion to allow commissions to be made with more ease, eg. Allow people to select amount of models quality of painting when the commision should be achieved by and allow the person fulfilling the commission to quote accordingly.

Depending on how many users it may be feasable to allow a function to allow people to search through different commissioners

## Build Status 

Under construction.
